# AncientRivals

Changed direction of game on a whim! 

Is now a side scrolling fighting game, with a shield and javalin, which moves sideways through map towards end point (boss?!).

Javalin thrown can kill many at once, shield thrown can knock back/stun. Only one of each, needs picking up (or summoning) to use again.

Most combat will either be hordes that need wiping out, special units (need stunning, goomba stomping, etc) or bosses. 

Interesting terrain to change how battles work (vertical?).

Potential for power ups, such as infinite javalins.
