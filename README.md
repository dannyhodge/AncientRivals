# AncientRivals

Multiplayer battle / point race (Kills, objectives and challenges all give points)

Basic Game requirements:
Kill opponents
Spawn with singular basic weapon can be used in melee and also be thrown (This uses up weapon)
Directional Attack and blocking
Platformer
Melee/thrown style weaponry (No modern weapons)
Potential power-ups/interactions with the map
Hits remove shield if not blocked correctly leaving open to being killed

Throwing spears at each other makes them deflect off each other
Maybe no shield? All based on dodging attacks and countering?
